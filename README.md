Hi, my name is Lynette and here is a space to showcase some of my statistics/data analysis projects. 

Thank you for visiting.

# [Modeling Hearing Aids](https://github.com/LAlibrary/Modeling_Hearing_Aids)

Hearing aids can be quite the investment. I have relatives who utilize hearing aids and their hearing aids have become an integral part of their everyday lives. 

In this project, I decided to research hearing aids to learn more about aid features and what influences styles/pricing.

Essentially, one of my main questions is - What predictors define a hearing aid style?

![Hearing Aid Styles](https://github.com/LAlibrary/LAportfolio/blob/main/hearingaidstyles.PNG)

I used a dataset I compiled consisting of hearing aid models and their features using the sites ZipHearing, HearingTracker, and hearing aid contracts (sources cited in report below).

A generalized logit model for nominal response was used in both SAS and R languages.

# [Visualizing The Markov Chain: Chord Progressions](https://github.com/LAlibrary/Markov_Chain_Chord_Progressions)

As formula-based music can be, there is also randomness involved. The possibility of any note is equally likely.
The Markov Property can be applied to music in the sense that while a note is random, it may depend only on the current note being played in a sequence. 

For this project, I chose to compare two of my favorite artists by their chord progression usage.
I chose the songs “Playing with Fire” and “Lovesick Girls” by Blackpink and “Landslide” and “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac.

I gathered chord progressions through the sites Chordify and HookTheory (cited in report below), and I constructed a vector of chords in R attributing to each song by each artist.

I then computed the transition probability matrices for each artist based on their chord progression among both songs.

## Statistical Experimental Design: The Fractional Factorial Design

This was a group project in which an experiment was conducted and a fractional factorial design was used to analyze the data collected. The effects of various factors on carbon dioxide gas production are analyzed in observing the chemical reaction between different vinegar and baking soda amounts among a series of different sized ballons.

![Balloon Reaction Process](https://github.com/LAlibrary/LAportfolio/blob/main/balloon.PNG)

This experiment investigates the interactions among balloon size, vinegar, and baking soda on their collective impact on carbon dioxide gas production. This response was measured by measuring the circumference of the inflated ballon after the chemical reaction was complete.
By implementing a fractional factorial design, this experiment examines these variables through three replicates, creating a comprehensive dataset of 12 observations. The objective of this experiment is to discern the individual and combined effects of the factors. Calculations were calulated by hand, and all factors were found to be statistically significant.
