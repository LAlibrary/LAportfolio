Hi my name is Lynette and this is a space to showcase some of my statistics and extracurricular projects.

Thank you for visiting.

## Visualizing The Markov Chain: Chord Progressions

For this project, I applied random processes statistical mehtods to music by comparing two of my favorite groups by their chord progression usage.
I chose the songs “Playing with Fire” and “Lovesick Girls” by Blackpink and “Landslide” and “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac.
I gathered chord progressions through the sites Chordify and HookTheory (cited in report below), and I constructed a vector of chords in R attributing to each song by each artist.
I then computed the transition probability matrices for each artist based on their chord progression among both songs.

## Statistical Experimental Design: The Fractional Factorial Design
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/200e3d41-09d1-4214-86c3-1972667abe83)

This was a group project in which an experiment was conducted and a fractional factorial design was used to analyze the data collected. 
This experiment investigates the interactions among balloon size, vinegar, and baking soda on their collective impact on carbon dioxide gas production. The objective of this experiment is to discern the individual and combined effects of the factors. Calculations were calulated by hand, and all factors were found to be statistically significant.

## Natural Language Processing: Coachella Sentiment Tweet Analysis
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc78cdb1-4191-4395-b08e-0ea8f44bb3f2)

Using Python, the goal of this report is to perform sentiment analysis to better understand what users think about the music festival Coachella, with emphasis on “negative” and “positive” tweets. The dataset used is a Kaggle dataset sourced by Social Media Data consisting of 2015 Coachella tweets. The festival has a strong social media presence that can be applicable in the field of data mining and natural language processing (NLP). Machine learning methods, word clouds, and a multinomial logistic regression were implemented with additional help from Python libraries such as TextBlob and NLTK.

## Survival Analysis: Applying the Cox Regression & Other Survival Methods on Hospitalization Data
Using SAS, this project applies the cox regression model, stratified cox model, and other statistical methods such as the Log-Rank Test and Kaplan Meier curves to help visualize and propose a final model and interpretation of the survival data (the Worcester Heart Attack Study, a study on long-term survival following hospitalization for an acute myocardial infarction). 

Below is a table of the model building process with variables (with * indicating significance) and the corresponding -2logL statistic, and AIC.

## Radio Show Project: Claws Radio
One of my projects is my radio show, "Claws Radio", that hosts weekly music themes through 22 West Radio, a student-run radio station located at Cal State Long Beach. In addition to writing radio scripts and promoting my radio hour via social media, I also curate Spotify playlists for each theme. 

[Click here to check out a playlist I curated to highlight producers Timbaland and Darkchild](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6FhkqmW2xWaNcUOTA5OQB1?si=f711685160df4df0)

Below are examples of graphics I designed to promote my radio show.
