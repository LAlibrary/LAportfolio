# Lynette's Project Portfolio

Hi, my name is Lynette and here is a space to showcase some of my statistics/data analysis projects. 

Thank you for visiting.

# [Project 1: Modeling Hearing Aids](https://github.com/LAlibrary/Modeling_Hearing_Aids)

Hearing aids can be quite the investment. I have relatives who utilize hearing aids and their hearing aids have become an integral part of their everyday lives. 

In this project, I decided to research hearing aids to learn more about aid features and what influences styles/pricing.

Essentially, one of my main questions is - What predictors define a hearing aid style?

In this project, I used a dataset I compiled consisting of hearing aid models and their features using the sites ZipHearing, HearingTracker, and hearing aid contracts (sources cited in report below).

A generalized logit model for nominal response was used in both SAS and R languages.

# [Project 2 : Visualizing The Markov Chain: Chord Progressions](https://github.com/LAlibrary/Markov_Chain_Chord_Progressions)

As formula-based music can be, there is also randomness involved. The possibility of any note is equally likely.
The Markov Property can be applied to music in the sense that while a note is random, it may depend only on the current note being played in a sequence. 

For this project, I chose to compare two of my favorite artists by their chord progression usage.
I chose the songs “Playing with Fire” and “Lovesick Girls” by Blackpink and “Landslide” and “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac. 

Using R, I computed the transition probability matrices for each artist.

I gathered chord progressions through the sites Chordify and HookTheory (cited in report below), and I constructed a vector of chords in R attributing to each song by each artist.
